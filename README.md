# automateWebTestingApp
a tool i created to automate an interal web based testing app using selenium &amp; python

# this tool allowed me to utilize test suites i wrote for groups of commands by their intents but without manually entering in parameters. with this tool i could open a private browser, login, then select and run the test i would like fully automated instead of wasting my time manually selecting the endpoints, commands, and other parameters.
